# open-learning
Open source framework for creating and distributing education. 

_This is an ongoing project. It is not complete, but I intend to chip away at it..._

For a while, I have been thinking about the open source model, what makes it successful, and how it can be applied to challenges other than software.

I think a few charactersitics that make open source successful are:
  
  * __COMMUNITY:__ First and foremost, the success of an open source project is usually determined by the strength of it's community. A large community usually means a large number of minds looking at, and examining the same problem. A large community has a larger selection pool of strengths, passions and motivations. In this document, I will refer to this 'cluster' of mental resources as a **_pool_**. 
  * __DIVERSITY:__ In short, there is a greater chance of a thousand people solving a riddle, than if it were one. As humans, we are all different. We all possess different qualities. It's what differentiates us (humans) from computers. If you instruct two computers with same archtecture to perform an operation, the results should be relatively consistent and predictable. If you ask two people from the same demographic to perform an operation, more often than not, there would be two different outcomes. It's what makes us 'human'. Each of us hold different assumptions, biases, etc.. One person likes oranges, another person likes apples. Increased diversity means a larger selection of people from different cultures, different demographics, with different likes and dislikes, who may approach a problem differently. I believe it enhances problem solving and innovation. 
  
  * __GOVERNANCE__: This are the rules that a community should adhere to. It determines whether a community is approchable, the __transparency__, and
